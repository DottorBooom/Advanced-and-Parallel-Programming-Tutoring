# Advanced-and-Parallel-Programming-Tutoring

Each session is made up of a file that contains the assignment, the starting structure, my solution and the professor's solution. <br /><br />
*Note: In some files my solution is not present or is the same as the professor's. This is due to the fact that I was not able to follow all the lessons and not doing the exercises on time.*
